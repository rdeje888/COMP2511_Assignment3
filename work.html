                            My first job was at McDonald's, where I worked part-time during high school. I learned valuable skills in customer service, time management, and teamwork. 
                            My responsibilities included taking orders, preparing food, and keeping the restaurant clean. 
                            Working at McDonald's taught me the importance of staying organized during busy shifts and working effectively with people from diverse backgrounds.

                            After working at McDonald's, I transitioned to a position at Fuji Ramen and Sushi as a server and later as a line cook. 
                            As a server, I learned about the importance of customer service and teamwork in the restaurant industry. 
                            My responsibilities included taking orders, serving food, and ensuring customer satisfaction. 
                            Later, as a line cook, I gained valuable experience in food preparation, kitchen management, and inventory control.

                            During my gap year, I worked at Costco as a food court assistant.
                            This role allowed me to develop my skills in food preparation, including following recipes, managing inventory, and maintaining a clean and safe work environment.
                            As a food court assistant, I interacted with a wide range of customers, where I honed my customer service skills 
                            and learned how to address customer needs in a timely and efficient manner.
                            I then went on to pursue CIS at Mount Royal University.
